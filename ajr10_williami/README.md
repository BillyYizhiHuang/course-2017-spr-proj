# Project Purporse/Narrative:

Cities are a very efficient way of storing humans. What is the efficiency cost of having trees and open spaces in a city? The scripts in this project take steps to draw correlations detailing this relationship.

We have collected data about how many open spaces and trees there are in Cambridge and Boston. Additionally, we have also collected data about the energy usage of each location.

We calculate the ratio of open space area to total area of the location, the CO2 usage per person, and the MMBTU usage per person. We then draw a connection between how much open space there is and how much extra energy is used in each location.

### Running our code

Run execute.py. There is nothing unique about the scripts in this project that require special steps.
