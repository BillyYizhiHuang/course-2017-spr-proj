Studies show that there is a correlation between access to public spaces, and the populations general level of happiness. Our project 1 has two objectives regarding this. Our primary objective is we want to see if this correlation holds true for the greater Boston area by observing and analysing available data.  Our secondary objective is to use what we learn from the initial analysis to propose location for new parks/public spaces to maximimize happiness gain. We will do this by observing three datasets: 1) Transportation Data, 2) Parks and Public Spaces data, and 3) Citizen Contentment/Reported happiness.
