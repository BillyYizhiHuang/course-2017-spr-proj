I am interested in safety in Boston. So I chose two datasets from OpenData named "Boston Police Stations" and "Colleges and Universities", two datasets from City of Boston Data Portal named "Crime Incident Reports (July 2012 - August 2015) (Source: Legacy System)" and "Crime Incident Reports (August 2015 - To Date) (Source: New System)" as well as five datasets from Boston Area Research Initiative Dataverse named "Homicides in Boston"(2012-2016). 
I would union "Crime Incident Reports" and "Homicides in Boston" as all crime incidents dataset. Since district ID and accurate position are provided, We can cluster these incidents and compare with police station location to see whether we need to add more police stations to solve these incidents. Besides that, we could take location of college and universities into consideration to help them do better protection on students.
