## 2.a

I am interested in the safety in Boston. So I chose two datasets from City of Boston Data Portal named [Crime Incident Reports (July 2012 - August 2015) (Source: Legacy System)](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incident-Reports-July-2012-August-2015-Sourc/7cdf-6fgx) and [Crime Incident Reports (August 2015 - To Date) (Source: New System)](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incident-Reports-August-2015-To-Date-Source-/fqn4-4qap), two datasets from Boston Open Data named [Boston Police Stations](http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e5a0066d38ac4e2abbc7918197a4f6af_6) and [Colleges and Universities](http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cbf14bb032ef4bd38e20429f71acb61a_2), as well as five datasets from Boston Area Research Initiative Dataverse named [Homicides in Boston(2012-2016)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/1J0IBN). 

We could union crime incidents datasets and university dataset to figure out "which university is the most safe one in Boston". And the union of crime incidents and police station could help us to find which police station need more efforts on its own district. Besides that, homcide is one of the most dangerous crime incidents in Boston. We could cluster the locations and pay more attention on these areas.

## 2.b

The algorithm that retrieve these datasets automatically is in the file: ```retrieve.py```.

## 2.c

Three non-trival transformations are as follows:

### Transformation 1

The script is in ```transformation1.py```. 

### Transformation 2

The script is in ```transformation2.py```. 

### Transformation 3

The script is in ```transformation3.py```.
