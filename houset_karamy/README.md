README for Project 1
--------------------
The five datasets that we have chosen can be combined to help determine a more efficient way to deal with crime. Currently, we are thinking of finding a better way to allocate our police forces in order to reduce crime rates. For example, we want to analyze the data in order to see which regions could use more police presence and which could use less, in order to send police to patrol the right areas instead of wasting resources.
