README for Project 1
--------------------
The datasets that we have chosen can be combined to help determine a more efficient way to deal with crime. We have used the Cambridge Open Data Portal, MassDOT Data Portal, and The City Of Boston Data Portals in order to retrieve the data needed. Currently, we are thinking of finding better patrol assignments to police forces in order to reduce crime rates. For example, we want to analyze the data in order to see which regions could use more police presence and which could use less in order to send police to monitor the right areas instead of wasting resources on regions that do not require that much police activity. In order to do this, we plan on narrowing down high crime rate regions and find the correlation between police presence and crime density. We will also try to take in extraneous factors such as holidays and weather as well.
