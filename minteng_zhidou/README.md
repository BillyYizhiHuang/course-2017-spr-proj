# Narrative

We want to find a best office location for a new company. The first factor we consider is the rent of the location, 
so we find the data of average rent for different cities in Greater-Boston. The second factor is convenient transportationï¼Œ 
then we fetch the MBTA data, we assume that the location will be more convenient if there are more stops around this location.
The third factor is food, we think the location is better if there are many restaurants around it. Similarly,
the fourth factor is safety, we donot want too many crimes appeared near the location. The last factor is salary, we may add some
fuctions related to different types of jobs.
