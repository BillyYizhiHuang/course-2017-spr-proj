# Narrative
We are using datasets of different healthy locations and a dataset of locations with high adult obesity. To get a dataset of healthy locations, we're combining several different datasets such as urban orchards, nutrition programs, and healthy corner stores. We'll be looking to see if there is any correlation between access to healthy locations and obesity. We're using Dijkstra's algorithm and the MBTA's dataset to find the shortest path from any given obesity location to the closest healthy location. We will also use linear regression to see how strong the correlation between access to healthy locations and obesity is. We are using trash bins as a control to make sure that any correlation we find is specific to the obesity locations. If we find that obesity is negatively correlated with the healthy locations, we can infer that obesity levels might decline in those areas if the City of Boston adds a healthy location there.
