# Project 1: Purpose
** Chloe Fortuna and Shahrez Jan**  

Boston's main resource is its people who mostly travel through bikes and automobiles. However, there can be many extraneous factors that can affect the speed and efficiency of commuting to work and school including potholes on the road and snowstorms. The purpose of this project is to determine the effects of potholes and snowstorms on the routes used by commuters, and in the future could be extended to create a more efficient route for commuting.

The five datasets we used contain bike routes, snow emergency routes, streets, parking meters, and the location of potholes in Boston. The data from the pothole locations can be combined with the routes for snow emergencies and bikers to determine how much they can deter the drivers on their way towards their destination. Parking meters can be used to locate parking spots for drivers when commuting to work. By combining this data, we are able to determine how these extraneous factors affect the roads of Boston.

## Running Code:
```python3 execute.py cfortuna_snjan19```  

This will the generate a provenance document that shows the activities that take place when Running the python scripts.
