# Project 1: Purpose

Boston is a city where many people ride bikes either for leisure or to commute to work or class. However, there are many factors that can affect the use of bikes within the city. Some examples of external factors that affect bike routes are potholes and snow emergencies. How strong is the effect of these external factors on bike routes?

We collected data about the different bike networks, the snow emergency routes, and the locations of potholes in Boston. Using this data, we can compare the locations of the different routes and the potholes to see how strong the correlation is between the two. With this, we can determine if there is a more efficient route to take in order to bike from one location to another.
