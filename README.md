#CS591 Project Proposal
####Sean Zhang & Martin Yim


  We are interested in identifying clusters of locations where parking tickets have been issued in Boston in the past. We are hoping to identify relationships between areas prone to being ticketed, and the area's characteristics (vehicle ownership, affluence, etc).
  
  We plan to use the K-Means algorithm to identify areas prone to more parking tickets (based on volume of tickets issued). By then relating these clusters with information such as property values in the area and vehicle tax (as a proxy for vehicle ownership) by zipcode, we hope to find areas where the supply of parking is not meeting the demand (hence, parking tickets). We could then use this information to share with the city of Boston to determine where more parking could be provided to meet citizens' parking needs. 

  Conversely, we are also hoping to use the data that we've gathered to find new locations in the city that could be an area of dense illegal parking in the future, based on car ownership, property value, and public transportation convenience. These areas may be under-enforced, and could yield revenue for the city, but may also prove to be areas which need consideration for more parking as well.
