Write a short narrative and justification (5-10 sentences) explaining how these data sets can be combined to answer an interesting question or solve a problem.

Explain the three nontrivial operations that were performed.


We were interested in using data to see if certain privileges, namely healthy food options, correlated with certain socioeconomic trends. We wanted to look at things like the locations of community gardens, food pantries, and farmers' markets as indications of healthier options in certain areas (by looking at available amounts by zip code). We then would try to crossreference this with the demographics of certain areas to see if people in different socioeconomic situations tend to be closer or further from the options. We also thought that medical situations (heart attacks, worse nutrition leading to injury, etc) might also give relevant information on the quality of the areas around these healthier options. 
Following intuition, we are hoping to see some sort of correlation between healthier eating options and higher living standards (richer areas might tend to have the luxury of organic options, and perhaps the ability to be more selective with what they buy). As for the medical events, perhaps we might see a higher amount of medical issues related to worse nutrition (weaker bones, more susceptible to viruses, higher risk of organ issues). Though we may need more data, we hope to see if there's a positive correlation between the healthy choices and higher living standards. Though it may not prove causation, the data could be used to inform infrastructure, or even businesses (offering more healthy options depending on the results).
