#CS591 Project Proposal
####Sean Zhang & Martin Yim


  We are interested in looking to identify gaps in supply and demand of public transportation routes across the city of Boston. Our five datasets are all related to transportation. We will be working with information about Parking Tickets, Vehicle Excise Tax, Taxi Rides, MBTA routes, and Roadway Events (massDOT). Using these datasets, we hope to identify new possible public transportation routes where the route has been traditionally served by taxi's or private car ownership.
