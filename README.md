Project 1 by jw0208 (Wei Ji)

In SO215 sociology of healthcare, I encountered the concept of Social Economic Status (SES), and it's importance in affecting people's
health. So for this project, I wanted to individually examine whether it is true that the level of education, the income and poverty
level really have a correlation with the health performance of a population within a state. I am also interested in discovering whether it is true
that the more spent in Medicare per patient can really leads to better health performance (there is a theory that the more spent on
Medicare does not necessarily leads to better health performance), thus I also combined the population's physically and mentally
unhealthy days with the level of expense spent for Medicare. Eventually, I would wish to see some correlation between these data sets.

The five data sets:
1. the percentage of population that has high school diploma / bachelor degree within each state in year 2015
2. the average annual household income within each state in 2015
3. the percentage of poverty population within each state in 2015
4. the per hospital Medicare spent per patient compare to national level within each state in year 2015
5. average physically and mentally unhealthy days in each state
