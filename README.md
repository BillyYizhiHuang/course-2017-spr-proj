#CS591 Project Proposal
####Sean Zhang & Martin Yim


  We are interested in looking to identify gaps in supply and demand of public transportation routes across the city of Boston. Our five datasets are all related to transportation. We will be working with information about Parking Tickets, Vehicle Excise Tax, Taxi Rides, MBTA routes, and Roadway Events (massDOT). Using these datasets, we hope to identify new possible public transportation routes where the route has been traditionally served by taxi's or private car ownership. 


  For example, for Boston University students it can be difficult to get from West Campus to Kendall Square area in Cambridge. The T is inefficient for this route, and walking or taking the bus is, likewise, not a great time investment. In this case, the best time offered by public transport is ~30 minutes and requires over a mile of walking. As a result, many students use Uber or other private taxi services in order to bridge public transport supply gap. We hope to identify cases such as the West Campus-Kendall Square route, where resources could be reallocated for better transportation experiences.
