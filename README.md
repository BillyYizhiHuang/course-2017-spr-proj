#CS591 Project Proposal
####Sean Zhang & Martin Yim


  We are interested in identifying clusters of locations where parking tickets have been issued in Boston in the past. We are hoping to identify a cause as to why these parking tickets were issued. Was it because the cars were parked on high value property? Was there less car ownership in the area? Or was it possibly because people had to park there because there was no convenient public transportation route?
  
  Studying these parking ticket clusters, we plan to use the K-Means algorithm to identify and hopefully find areas of Boston where the city could build a new parking garage or lot for public parking so that these parking tickets are avoided. Conversely, we are also hoping to use the data that we've gathered to find new locations in the city that could be an area of dense illegal parking in the future, based on car ownership, property value, and public transportation convenience.
