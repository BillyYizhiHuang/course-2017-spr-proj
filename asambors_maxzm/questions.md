### Questions for Office Hours
#### Provenance
  * When we add cdc data, do I include the full url with the offset and limit parameters for SODA API? 
  * Usage: Do I need to write a specific query as seen in example.py?
  * this_script = doc.agent('alg:asambors_maxzm#fetchData', {prov.model.PROV_TYPE:prov.model.PROV['SoftwareAgent'], 'ont:Extension':'py'})
    * Should this be #(file name/class name) or is it arbitrary?  

#### Transformations
  * Was this supposed to be done on the mongo side entirely?
