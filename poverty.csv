"See the county-level poverty rates from the 1990 and 2000 Census of Population.See important notes about intercensal model-based poverty estimates.The 2013 rural-urban continuum codes classify metropolitan counties (codes 1 through 3) by size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and nonmetropolitan counties (codes 4 through 9) by degree of urbanization and proximity to metro areas. See rural-urban continuum codes for precise definitions of each code.Source: Bureau of the Census, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates.",
