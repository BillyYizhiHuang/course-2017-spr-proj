# Transformations we are doing
1. Find the location of "obesity rates" in cdc and see if there is a correlation between that and how far people are from swimming pools and healthy corner stores

2. sleep rates and correlation to university locations

3. Lack of doctor visits and correlation to hospital locations

# Narrative

Write a short narrative and justification (5-10 sentences) explaining how these data sets can be combined to answer an interesting question or solve a problem. You do not need to solve the actual problem in this project, and it is acceptable to merely combine data sets in a way that is likely to support one or more solutions involving the particular data you choose. Include this narrative in a README.md file within your directory (along with any documentation you may write in that file).

Your README.md file should list any idiosyncratic details associated with the services and/or credentials needed to run your scripts.
