Short narrative and justification explaining how data sets can be combined to answer an interesting question or solve a problem. 

Data Sets:
1. Boston Police Department Crime Data
2. Boston Police Department Field Interrogation and Observation Data
3. Boston Police Department Locations Data
4. Cambridge Police Department Citation Data
5. Cambridge Police Department Crime Data
6. Cambridge Police Department Location Data

Currently our data sets come from three sources: Boston Data Portal, Cambridge Data Portal, and Google Maps. These data sets allow you to analyze the location of crimes relative to the police station locations in both Boston and Cambridge. These data sets when combined can allow you to look into a wide variety of problems: Where does crime most occur in Boston and Cambridge? Does the location of a Police Department close to an area heavily prevent/reduce crime in that area? Where would the optimal location be to place another police department? How are police districts drawn? How might they be redrawn to better service local crime?
