##Narrative
In this project, we aim to combine all data sets about aerobic and recreational places in Boston such as swimming pools , public parks and water play park, so that we could use the resulting new datasets for later development of the Project 2 and to see how sportive Boston's neighborhoods are by counting how many recreational places per in each neighborhood.
Since some open datasets we chose from online resources have no zipcode as an attribute and the coordinates are messy, we determined to attribute a specific park or pool to a neighborhood rather than a zipcode.
##Datasets
The six datasets we used:
<ol>
<li>'seasonalSwimPools':'https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/xw3e-c7pz.json'</li>
<li>'communityGardens':'https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/rdqf-ter7.json'</li>
<li>'openSpaceCambridge':'https://data.cambridgema.gov/api/views/5ctr-ccas/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD'</li>
<li>'waterplayCambridge':'https://data.cambridgema.gov/api/views/hv2t-vv6d/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD'</li>
<li>'openSpaceBoston':'http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2868d370c55d4d458d4ae2224ef8cddd_7.geojson'</li>
<li>'commCenterPools':'http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5575f763dbb64effa36acd67085ef3a8_0.geojson'</li>
</ol>

##Transformation Processes
Firstly we can obtain the number of average earnings in each zipcode area by using MapReduce to project and reduce to get the total earnings and counts in each zipcode, then we can obtain the average earning by (total earning divides counts) for each zipcode area.

Secondly we can obtain number of hospital, number of garden, number of store and number of school group by the zipcode by applying the simple MapReduce Function.

Combining all datasets generated by the second step, we obtained a num of these building grouped by the zipcodes.

Lastly, we merge the previous dataset with the average earnings dataset to obtain a dataset that contains the number of these buildings and average earning using zipcode as unit.

##Three Output Datasets

<li>'allOpenSpacesInBoston' - output of combineAllOpenSpaces.py</li>
<li>'allRecreationalPlaces'- output of combineAll.py</li>
</ol>
